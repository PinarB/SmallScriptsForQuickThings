Created by PÄ±nar Barlas; first uploaded to Github October 2020.

PURPOSE/FUNCTION: 
Goes through a directory to generate a list (.txt file) with every subfolder and the number of files each
subfolder contains. See the attached ReadMe for more information.

TO USE:
1. Update directoryPath variable at the top to your directory containing the folders to be processed.
2. Update unwantedFolders list to include the exact name of the folders to be ignored in the listing process.
3. Update savePath variable at the top to your directory where the resulting text file should be saved.
4. Update saveName to the desired file name for the resulting text file (without extension).

FYI:
* The items in the resulting file indicate the names of the subfolders, and in parantheses, the number of files
within that subfolder. There is no distinction regarding the file types or other details of the files; this 
may be added in the future. 
* Also, the code is not very "clean" and will probably be tidied up in the future with functions.
