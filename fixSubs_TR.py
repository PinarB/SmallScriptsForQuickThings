"""
Created by PÄ±nar Barlas; first uploaded to Github October 2020.

PURPOSE/FUNCTION: 
Goes through all .srt files in a directory, makes sure they are all encoded
as utf8 (saving a copy encoded with utf8 if not). Created to deal with wrongly-encoded Turkish
subtitles, which usually have the encoding cp1254.
See the attached ReadMe for more information.

TO USE:
1. Update directoryPath variable at the top to your directory containing the files to be fixed.

FYI:
* Checked with Windows only.
* Made to work with Turkish subtitles only; with one specific (wrong) encoding.
* Has an option (commented out) to replace the original file instead of saving a copy; take care
when replacing.
* Currently allows other file types to be processed; this doesn't seem necessary so in the future
the code might be simplified by hard-coding the .srt file extension instead of reading from a list.

    Tries to open .srt file with the encoding type that messes up Turkish characters. If the lines
    can be read properly in this mode (indicating the file has the wrong encoding), then the file is 
    saved with the correct encoding (utf8). If the lines cannot be read, there is a UnicodeDecodeError,
    indicating that the file was already encoded correctly - so no further actions are taken.
    A copy of the file is saved with a suffix; a commented line allows the code to replace the original
    file instead of creating a copy.
