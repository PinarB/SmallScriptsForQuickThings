"""
Created by PÄ±nar Barlas; first uploaded to Github October 2020.

PURPOSE/FUNCTION: 
Goes through a directory to generate a list (.txt file) with every file in the (sub)directories.
See the attached ReadMe for more information.

TO USE:
1. Update directoryPath variable at the top to your directory containing the files to be processed.
2. Update fileTypes list to reflect the file extensions to be processed.
3. Update savePath variable at the top to your directory where the resulting text file should be saved.
4. Update saveName to the desired file name for the resulting text file (without extension).

FYI:
* The listed items have the subdirectory at the beginning of the line (if not in parent directory),
and the list is alphabetized - this allows for visual grouping of items. i.e. Files under the same
folder appear together, like "Archived\\some_file".

# the files to be counted/listed are in folder:

# the files to be counted/listed have the extension(s):
fileTypes = ['.mkv', '.avi', '.mp4']

# the resulting txt file will be saved in folder:
savePath = 'C:\\my\\folder'
# the resulting txt file will be titled:
saveName = 'The name of the text file'

# initializing empty lists
