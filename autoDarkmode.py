"""
Created by PÄ±nar Barlas; first uploaded to Github October 2020.

PURPOSE/FUNCTION: 
Checks whether it's daytime or nighttime based on current system time,
updates the registry to change Windows to dark/light mode to match. Meant to be run automatically 
via a batch file.
See the attached ReadMe for more information.

TO USE:
Nothing needs to be changed.

FYI:
* Works only on Windows.
* Current thresholds are 7am - 6pm, and hard-coded; future version may extract this variable for easier
updates and personalization. 
* Future version might also switch from 1s and 0s to True and False for functions/variables.
